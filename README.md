# Positional_numbers_converter

The program allows you to convert numbers in positional systems for bases 2 to 10. 
Input data:
- base of the converted number;
- the number to be converted;
- the basis for which we are to replace.
Output data:
- the result as a number with the target base.

Example result:
38 (10) = 100110 (2)

You can:
- current converting (in terminal, program asks for all input data);
- prepare file:
   * one type of convertion with know numbner of examples;
   * all type of convertion.

Additionally:
- program detects wrong characters in number (ex. using digit 2 in number declare to base 2).


In the future...:
- enabling conversion to numbers with bases up to 16 inclusive (use of digits a, b, c, d, e);
- enabling conversion to non-positional systems (e.g. additive - Roman).
